## Usage of Uglifier

Keep all JavaScript files installed in this directory /%THEME_ROOT%/js and the Afterburner Grunt Scaffolding Tool will automatically minify and concatenate each of the files and store them in a single file named {package-name}.min.js in /%THEME_ROOT%/js/

Note {package-name} is whatever you set the project name as when you initialized the project (i.e. issued **grunt-init wp-theme** on the command line)
