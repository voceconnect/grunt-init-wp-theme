## Usage of Imagemin

Keep all image files installed in this directory /%THEME_ROOT%/img and the Afterburner Grunt task will optimize your JPG and PNG files and replace them with your existing files. 

If you need to customize any of the imagemin task, edit the **imagemin** object's properties in the Gruntfile.js file in the root. See the [github plugin page](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin) for customization options.
